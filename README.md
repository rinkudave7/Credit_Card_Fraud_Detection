# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Objective
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.
## Observations
- The data set is highly skewed, consisting of 492 frauds in a total of 284,807 observations. This resulted in only 0.172% fraud cases. This skewed set is justified by the low number of fraudulent transactions.
- The dataset consists of numerical values from the 28 'Principal Component Analysis (PCA)' transformed features, namely V1 to V28. Furthermore, there is no metadata about the original features provided, so pre-analysis or feature study could not be done.
- There is no missing value in the dataset.
## Description
- Credit Card Fraud Detection is a Binary classification problem where we predict that whether a particular transaction is fraudlent or not..
